# ezctf

## What?

It is a hypothetical alternative to https://ctftime.org

## Why?

CTFtime.org is an amazing website. It works and it has a great community
around it. The only reason that I wish to create ezctf is because I'm
getting bored. Although now that I think of it, it is too much effort.

That being said, what will be different from CTFtime.org?

In the beginning, ezctf will only scrape data from CTFtime.org and aim
towards providing a better user experience. Having a true alternative to
CTFtime.org will require people to actually know about ezctf first,
building a true alternative is only a secondary goal.

## How?

Since CTFtime.org gets to know about new CTFs when CTF organizers submit a
form, we will simply scrape upcoming CTFs and their scoreboards for now.

The primary goal for now is to see:

- upcoming CTFs
- team rankings
- past writeups

Unlike CTFtime.org, ezctf will not have any registration forms. It will be
a purely static website that will show upcoming CTFs and team rankings.

So essentially it will be: an open platform where CTFers can know about
upcoming CTFs, get rankings for their teams, and read past CTF writeups.
